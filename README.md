# Filop-language
Filop is a semantic language for defining architecture, logic, and data flow across any platform. Write readable project logic, trigger flows, loop conditions, and generate code. Use Project() blocks with end(save/generate) to store or build instantly. Filop can be embedded into AI tools via memory for native syntax support.
